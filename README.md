# Data-Narrative_Tennis-Major-Tournaments
The following repo presents forth a Data Narrative on a dataset using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and graphical aid using plotly.
## The Overview
The Narrative was part of the **ES-114: Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization** course offered to the first-year B.Tech students for the first time at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.**
The Machine Learning Course **ES-113: Data Centric Computing** here at **IIT, Gandhinagar,** was conducted in coherence with this course.
The Narrative allowed for the analysis of the the [Tennis Major Tournaments](https://doi.org/10.24432/C54C7K) dataset using **Clustering, Classification,** and **Regression**. Several of Probabilistic and Data Analystic tools like **Covariance Matrices, Correlation Factors,** and **Principal Components Analysis** were employed in the narrative.

## Libraries used and Analysis Approach
The following is the list of Python Libraries used for the narrative:
1. **Pandas**
2. **NumPy**
3. **Scikit-Learn**
> * sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB
> * sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
> * sklearn.decomposition.PCA
> * sklearn.cluster.KMeans
> * sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score
> * sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
4. **Plotly**
